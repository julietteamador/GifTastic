# GifTastic
Chose a topic and create an api key of the topic 
Once the topic is chosen, create the html 
I created buttons of the topic 
After that was created, create the javascript button with the api key 
Then create the ajax function.. that way once you click on the buttons the gif images appear. 
Afterwards, make the images pause and unpause
**Add a show to the following page using the add show key 
once you add show it should appear as a button and gifs will appear.
